The wicked git wiki

## JS Git libraries comparison

Full JS implementations:

- [nodegit](https://github.com/tbranyen/nodegit) (need python and cmake installed on the server)
- [Gitteh](https://github.com/libgit2/node-gitteh) (need cmake installed on the server)

nodegit has slightly better doc and more commits.

Wrappers around Git CLI:

- [Gift](https://github.com/sentientwaffle/gift)
- [node-git](https://github.com/creationix/node-git/) (doesn't work on Node 0.8)
- [node-git](https://github.com/christkv/node-git/) (half JS implementation, half CLI wrapper)
